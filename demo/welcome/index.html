          <h2>Re-Visiting our Web</h2>
          <p>The scenery.js Javascript tool was developed while investigating our uses of the web and web browsers, and trying to determine successful techniques around what makes websites 'cool', 'memorable', 'hot', or any other positive adjectives.</p>
          <p>We have come a long way from the early days of the web, which was assembled as a tool to help transmit documents electronically from point A to point B.</p>
          <p>We have moved well into an era of 'web applications', a period which has seen an expansion of the utility of web browsers from a tool for document retrieval, to becoming a tool that you can operate your life from (checking email, scheduling meetings, going shopping, preparing invoices, doing your accounting, booking horse rentals).</p>
          <p>
          Along the way, some clever individuals have also managed to create some cool experiences within the web browser. They have created websites that are a joy to browse. They have created web applications that are fun to interact with. They have created web experiences that we tell others about. Dazzling, clever, unique, surprising experiences.</p>
          <p>
          In assessing these scenarios, however, it quickly comes to light that a great deal of work went into making this happen.</p>
          <p>
          "Make it do that thing" can generally translate into weeks of effort.
          </p>
          <p>
          To that degree, <strong>scenery.js</strong> has emerged with the hopes of being a helpful tool to allow designers to be free to tackle some interesting experiences related to the scrollbar, and equip developers with some familiarity with HTML, CSS, and Javascript with a reliable tool to make these implementations easier.</p>
